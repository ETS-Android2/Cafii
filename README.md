In this contemporary world, many new software and applications have arrived and they have given all the comforts that the programmer or user has demanded. But still, there are some demands which still have not been solved. So, we are here to present the most useful feature that is Cafii. In everyday life, we are using one or more electronic gadgets and after the covid-19 pandemic, it has become mandatory to perform most of the tasks through the digital method that is the internet. If you are a user who is constantly using the gadget screen for a long time but sometimes then Cafii is the solution.
 
The user can't change the screen on time repeatedly in the device-specific settings. Cafii is a better solution that increases the screen on time with a single click or tap within the app. It is an android app for the implementation of a temporary screen on time. It is written in Java language. It prevents the screen from turning off. We have provided 5 types of presets that users mostly use. Therefore, if the user is taking the control of the device screen using Cafii then he/she does not need to interfere with the default device screen settings.
