    <string name="INFO">\n\nWelcome\n\nHere are some tips for using our App :-\n\n-> It is
        recommended to whitelist the App from Battery Optimization, also allow it to run in
    background.\n\n-> If any Profile is activated do not force stop and it is recommended not
     to remove from recents since some OS can kill the App instantly.\n\n-> It may happen that
     30 min and never profile is not available or behave ambiguously in your device due to some
        restrictions.\n\nThanks for using our App ‚ù§\n\n\nDevelopers -\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIshaan Kaushal &amp; Himank Bose\n</string>
